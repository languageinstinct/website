# The Strokes
Some good songs to start with:

- **[You Only Live Once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT68FS3YbQ4)**: This song explores the complexities of human behavior and freedom to live authentically.

- **[Bad Decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbZTnZDvPA)**: "The song
  interpolates the main melody from Billy Idol’s hit July 1981 single “Dancing
  With Myself,” as Julian sings a self-aware commentary about the band’s
  interaction with its fans and the music scene." -genius

- **[The Modern Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzO7IGWGxu8)**: "The track is an observation of life’s idiosyncrasies in “modern” times" -genius

I highly recommend checking out their live songs. A youtube channel called "Instrokers" has a great video that highlights their best performance for each of their songs, I will link it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvAmBAZqHVU&t=8s)
